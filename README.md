# WatchedThat

WatchedThat is an Android app that allows users to search, filter and retrieve information about movies and TV shows. It uses the public API from The Movie Database.

The user can also store movies and TV shows in two lists. One of them contains the visual media the user wants to see, the _wishlist_. The other one contains those they have already watched, the _watched that list_. The movies and TV shows in these two lists are stored locally in the Android device.
